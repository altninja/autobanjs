# AutoBanJS

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to ban users based on specific input criteria. The application checks user input and saves the user's information to a MongoDB database if the input matches a banned phrase.

It was generated by using 5 GPT4 prompts in a sequence, resulting in 2 bash scripts which created this repository.
